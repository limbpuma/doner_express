## 3. General Information and Mandatory Information

### Data Protection

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains which data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.

### Notice about the Responsible Party

The responsible party for data processing on this website is:

Example Company
Sample Street 10
90210 Sample City
Phone: +49 (0) 123 44 55 66
E-mail: info@example.com

The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).

### Storage Duration

Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the deletion will occur after these reasons cease to apply.

### General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on this Website

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is also based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. The data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The respective legal bases on which the processing is based are provided in this privacy policy.

### Notice Regarding Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries

We use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We point out that in these countries, no data protection level comparable to that of the EU can be guaranteed.

We point out that the USA is considered a secure third country, with a data protection level comparable to that of the EU. Data transfer to the USA is therefore permissible if the recipient is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has appropriate additional guarantees. Information on transfers to third countries, including recipients, can be found in this privacy policy.

### Recipients of Personal Data

In the context of our business activities, we cooperate with various external entities. In doing so, the transfer of personal data to these external entities may be necessary. We only pass on personal data to external entities if this is necessary within the framework of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.

### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

### Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)

If the data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which the processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your affected personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO).

If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such advertising purposes; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection according to Art. 21 para. 2 DSGVO).

### Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority

In the event of violations of the DSGVO, the affected persons have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, their workplace, or the location of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.

### Information, Correction, and Deletion

Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing at any time and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.

### Right to Restriction of Processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it is not clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.

### SSL or TLS Encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

## 4. Data Collection on this Website

### Cookies

Our internet pages use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packages that do not cause any harm to your end device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or an automatic deletion is carried out by your web browser.

Cookies can be from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (third-party cookies). Third-party cookies allow the integration of certain services of third-party companies within websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).

Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.

Cookies required to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions desired by you (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies to measure the web audience) are stored based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. Insofar as consent for the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG); the consent can be revoked at any time.

You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.

Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.

### Inquiry by E-Mail, Telephone, or Fax

If you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.

The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the performance of a contract or necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.

The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete them, revoke your consent to store them, or the purpose for data storage ceases to apply (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – especially statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.

### Privacy Policy for Social Media Profiles

We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.

Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, etc., can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively when you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or advertising banners). Visiting our social media presences triggers numerous data processing operations relevant to data protection. In detail:

If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Your personal data may also be recorded even if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data collection occurs, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.

With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, interest-based advertising can be displayed to you inside and outside the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, the interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or have logged in.

Please also note that we cannot trace all processing processes on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, further processing operations may be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. For details, please refer to the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.

**Legal Basis**

Our social media presences are intended to ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on different legal bases, which must be specified by the social network operators (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO).

**Responsible Party and Assertion of Rights**

If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered by this visit. You can assert your rights (information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability, and complaint) both against us and against the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g., Facebook).

Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider.

**Storage Period**

The data directly collected by us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage ceases to apply. Stored cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.

We have no influence on the storage duration of your data, which is stored by the operators of the social networks for their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy policy, see below).
